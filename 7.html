7 Days to Die is an early access survival horror video game set in an open world developed by The Fun Pimps. It was released through Early &nbsp;Access on 
Steam for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X on December 13, 2013, and for Linux on November 22, 2014. Versions for the &nbsp;PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were 
released in 2016 through Telltale Publishing, but are no longer being developed. In late 2022, The Fun Pimps &nbsp;announced that the game will be re-released
 on consoles targeting Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. It is also available on Xbox One via Game &nbsp;Pass, but still unknown if it will return on PlayStation 4.
<br><br>
&nbsp;The game's events happen during aftermath of a nuclear Third World War that destroyed an extremely large part of the world, except for some areas &nbsp;such as the fictional
 county of Navezgane, Arizona. The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food and water, as well &nbsp;as scavenging supplies to fend off the 
 numerous zombies (hinted to be the consequence of nuclear fallout, a new strain of flu, or both) that populate &nbsp;Navezgane. Though there is no real objective except surviving
 at this moment, the developers promised a dynamic storyline in the Kickstarter and &nbsp;stretch goals. The video with more explanation has since been removed by the developer.
